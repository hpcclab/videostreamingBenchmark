This folder collect the benchmarking result of executing single parameter changing on each of the standardized video segment.

Each one of 100 folders in ./RawFormat/ is a subfolder for each of the standardized video.
Then ./RawFormat/*/ where * is the video number, contains four text files. Each of them represent one transcoding operation. In each of them, 30 times repeated transcoding with 2 parameters of each operation was done to each and every single video segment of that video.

Those data are then parsed in a specific format to be used in CVSE project inside ./parsedFormatForCVSE_Project

This dataset is prepared by Te Ann Yap.
