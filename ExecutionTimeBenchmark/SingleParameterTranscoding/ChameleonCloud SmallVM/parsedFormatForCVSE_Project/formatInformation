This folder includes the video transcoding time for use with CVSE emulation mode. 
Each record of the text file shows the mean and SD of execution time for transcoding only one parameter of a video segment. 
The content of the workload trace is summarized from the 30-times execution (raw data) that can be found in ../RawFormat/*/* folder.

The format in each row of the trace is as follows:
Operation, parameterNumber (0/1), videoNumber_segmentNumber ,mean (milli-second),SD

In the above format:
**ParameterNumber** represents the specification of the destination format. 
For instance, 0 for Resolution means converting the source video format to 1080p amd 1 for Resolution means 360p

**videoNumber_segmentNumber** represents the video number and the segment within that.
For instance, 1_10 means video number 1 and segment#10
