SingleParameterTranscoding folder include transcoding which changes one parameter of the standardized video segment at a time, with the required scripts to perform such benchmarking.

MultipleParameterTranscoding folder include transcoding which changes three parameters of the standardized video segment in one transcoding operation (output one video with three parameters changed). This is different from task merging dataset where multiple transcoding operations merged together still output multiple files.
