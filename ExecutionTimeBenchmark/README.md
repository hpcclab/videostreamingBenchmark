NOTE: currenly, only Single ParameterTranscoding dataset is completed.

SingleParameterTranscoding folder include transcoding which is changing one parameter of the standardized video segment at a time and required scripts to perform the benchmarking.

MultipleParameterTranscoding folder include transcoding which changes three parameters of the standardized video segment in one transcoding operation which result in ONE output file. This is different from merging where multiple transcoding operations in merging format result in multiple output file. (TOBE COMPLETED)
