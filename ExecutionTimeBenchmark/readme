SingleParameterTranscoding include transcoding which is changing one parameter of the standardized video segment at a time and required scripts to perform the benchmarking.
MultipleParameterTranscoding include transcoding which changes three parameters of the standardized video segment in one transcoding operation which result in ONE output file. This is different from merging where multiple transcoding operations in merging format result in multiple output file.
