# videostreamingBenchmark
This project includes 100 video streams in standardized format and their transcoding information and merging efficiency info.

Considering the widespread use of video format and convenience of video transcoding, we define the video standard format as follows: 
  ✦codec: H.264/AVC
  ✦resolution: 720P
  ✦frame rate: 30
  ✦bite rate: average 4500kbps
  
The benchmark contains:

  [1] Original video(3.35GB) | [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive)
  
  [2] Original video with split(2.40GB) | [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive)
  
  [3] Standard video with split(3.10GB) | [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive)
