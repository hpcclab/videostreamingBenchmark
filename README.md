# Video Streaming Benchmark Dataset
This repository includes 100 videos that are gathered in a variety of content diversity (i.e. fast/slow pace, action, scenery, animation etc.) All 100 videos are represented in [1] their original form, [2] 2-second splitted video segments and finally, [3] 2-second splitted video segments that converted into the standardized format. We also include their transcoding information and their task merging efficiency data. This dataset is collected for the project named "Evaluating and Predicting the Impact of MergingVideo Processing Micro-Services on CloudResource Usage".
